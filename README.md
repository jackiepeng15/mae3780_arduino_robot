# mae3780_arduino_robot
An autonomous robot built using an Arduino microcontroller and various sensors to complete a Cube Craze challenge against other robots. Project completed December 2019.

# The challenge
The objective of the Cube Craze project is to design and construct a robot that moves cubes in a competition against other classmates. The goal of each one-on-one match is to have more cubes on your starting side than on your opponent’s side at the end of one minute. In order to construct our robot, we utilized an Arduino Uno to control our robot, Atmel Studio to write code for our robot’s behavior, and tools supplied in our bin to physically build the robot. Our report (included in repo) outlines the motivation behind our design, a flowchart of our gameplay strategy, our robot’s strengths and weaknesses, a review of how we performed in the competition, as well as future modifications that can be done to our robot.

# Robot features
Color sensors, QTI sensors, laser-cut self-deploying acrylic "arms", wheels powered using motors, H-bridge (built from scratch on a breadboard using resistors, LEDs, and transistors)
